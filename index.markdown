        <h2>About Us!</h2>
            Welcome to the official website of DWDS and EFT. Founded in 1807 and 2020, we offer debate to all Exeter students in a variety of formats, regardless of experience. Both clubs were founded to cultivate meaningful discussions and critical thinking skills among members of the Exeter community. This website will include information about both programs and house a variety of resources including our schedule, cirriculum, and constitution.
            <br><br>
            We welcome all members of the Exeter community to explore our website and learn more about our programs. Whether you are a current member, prospective student, or interested in attending one of our events, we invite you to join us in the exciting world of debate and forensics. Thank you for visiting our website, and we hope to see you soon!
