### About Parliamentary Debate

We compete the in the "Parliamentary" debate format. While the specific rules of parliamentary debate differ from region to region and nation to nation, all forms originate from the spirit of debates of the British Parliament. Specific rules can be found on this [DANEIS file](http://daneis.org/Parli_Rules-POIs-FINAL-1.pdf)

In each parliamentary debate round, two sides consisting of two debaters each will debate a "resolution." The resolution suggests a change from the status quo and each side of the debate, the Government and the Opposition, are tasked with convincing the Speaker (the judge) to either pass or reject the resolution. The "Government" will argue for passing the resolution while the "Opposition" will argue against.

Resolutions in parliamentary debate change from round to round and are not revealed to the debaters until the start of a round. The Government is given the liberty to define the terms of the resolution within reason.

After the sides and a resolution are chosen, the two teams are given 10 minutes to prepare a case before returning to deliver their speeches. With the exception of the Prime Minister, each debater only speaks once. The speech times are as follows:

* Prime Minister (First Government Speaker): 5 minutes
* Member of the Opposition (First Opposition Speaker): 8 minutes
* Minister of the Crown (Second Government Speaker): 8 minutes
* Leader of the Opposition (Second Opposition Speaker): 8 minutes
* Prime Minister's Second Speech: 3 Minutes

The Prime Minister's role in their first speech is to introduce the Government case. In the middle three speeches, debaters alternate rebuilding their arguments while refuting their opponents'. During the last three minutes of the LO's speech and the PM's second speech, the LO and the PM will "crux" the debate, or summarize the debate, weigh the two cases, and explain to the Speaker why they have won.

Parliamentary debate also utilizes Points of Information (POIs.) A debater can ask a POI of the opposing team to ask a clarifying question or to offer a real-time rebuttal of an argument. POIs must be phrased as questions.

The extemporanous nature of parliamentary debate encourages debaters to learn about the world around them and think critically to find the most persausive arguments to convince the Speaker. Compared to other debate formats, parliamentary debate utilizes less hard evidence and more logic and rhetoric.
