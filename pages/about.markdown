### About the Society

The Daniel Webster Debate society was founded in 1807 as the Phillips Exeter Rhetorical Society, making it the oldest secondary school debate team in the United States. Originally a secret society, the club would hold debates, wrote declamations, and presented extemporaneous speeches, ranging on topics such as "Should Exeter Be Coeducational?” In the early 20th century, Exonians journeyed to Cambridge or New Haven to face off with debaters at America's most prestigious institutions. By 1906, the first Exeter-Andover Debate took place. With the founding of the Debating Association of New England Independent Schools (DANEIS) in 1978, Exonians regularly debate with fellow boarding school students across the region. Today, the Daniel Webster Debate Society retains many of the same values it had from its founding—developing rhetorical speaking, persuasive argumentation, eloquence, and substantial general knowledge in the minds of many Exonians.

Currently, we are a member of [DANEIS](http://daneis.org/wordpress/) and compete against other independent schools in the "Parliamentary" debate format. This format of debate utilizes extemporaneous speaking and encourages debaters to build holistic bases of knowledge and think on their feet. More information on the format can be found on our [resources](/resources/) page.

The Society meets every Tuesday at 7PM in the Assembly Hall for cirriculum meetings and Wednesdays Thursdays and Fridays for practice debates.
